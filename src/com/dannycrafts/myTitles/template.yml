# Messages support colors. To implement a color into a message, start the text you want to color with '&x', where 'x' is a color code from '0' to '9' or 'a' to 'f'. Here is the list of supported color codes:

# '&0' - Black
# '&1' - Dark Blue
# '&2' - Dark Green
# '&3' - Teal
# '&4' - Dark Red
# '&5' - Purple
# '&6' - Gold
# '&7' - Gray
# '&8' - Dark Gray
# '&9' - Blue
# '&a' - Bright Green
# '&b' - Aqua
# '&c' - Red
# '&d' - Pink
# '&e' - Yellow
# '&f' - White

# Also note that player names might contain color codes too, so it is a good practice to start off with a color code after player - and display names.

# Most template messages have parameters, to include a parameter in the message, use '$parameter_name$' where 'parameter_name' is the name of the parameter.
